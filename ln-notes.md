============

*  Cloned Sara's repository to local

* Work on features:

> * Could clicking on the plot freeze the highlighted detector elements, until the next click (or off-plot click)? Like, ideally, the user could do:
>     * Hover over a given eta,phi location to see the relevant detector elements
>     * Click to freeze
>     * Copy the list of relevant detector elements with the cursor for using elsewhere
> * Could there be an additional user text box for querying a specific eta,phi, instead of using the cursor? Like if the user is told there is a problem at eta=X.XXX and phi=Y.YYY, they could enter this directly instead of getting this approximately correct with the cursor.
